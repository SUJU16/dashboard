##The problem
Event organizers have trouble getting their attendees to the event venue. Public transportation may not be enough and organizing custom transportation is expensive and time-consuming. The best practice for custom transportation so far is to organize a route from a pre-defined point X to the venue using a pre-defined schedule.

The customers will still have to travel to point X before they can use the arranged transportation. They will have to schedule their day based on the transportation's schedule. If they don't want to deal with these problems they can choose to use their own car or get a taxi/UBER, which gets expensive really fast.

##The solution
Our project for Junction 2016 aims to solve the problem by using [Sohjoa](http://sohjoa.fi/) to organize the custom transportation. Our concept is a tool for event-organizers that allows them to design the parameters that the Sohjoa bus should try to optimize while deciding its route dynamically. Our tool makes the required optimizations to the route, chooses a smart way to transport people from their desired pick-up location and tells Sohjoa which route and schedule to follow during the transportation.

##The use cases
